# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple OCR (Optical Character Recognition) UI built with Angular. It allows users to authenticate using their Google account.

## Implemented Features

*   **UI:**
    *   A simple UI with the text "OCR-UI" centered and animated with a colorful gradient.
    *   A "Login with Google" button.
    *   When logged in, it displays the user's profile picture, display name, and a "Logout" button.
    *   The "Login with Google" button is located below the "OCR-UI" title.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Firebase authentication with Google Sign-In.
    *   Users can log in and out.
*   **Build Configuration:**
    *   The build output path is set to `dist/cloudflare` to support Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Current Goal

The application is functionally complete for the initial phase. The next steps would be to add the core OCR functionality.
